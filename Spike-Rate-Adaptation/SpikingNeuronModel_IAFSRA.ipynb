Otherwise, you may run into errors when executing a code cell. Each code cell has a Play button next to it which will execute the code. (Some code may be hidden by default. This is generally because the code is more complex and is not necessary to understand in order to complete the model implementations or to answer the chapter Coding Challenge Problems).\n",

If you accidently change a cell, such as a line of code and/or run into errors as you try to run subsequent blocks, simply refresh the page, OR go to the *Runtime menu* and select *Restart runtime*. It is also suggested that you go to the *Edit menu* and select *Clear all outputs*. This will always allow you to revert the notebook to the original version (though you will have to run each code block again.)\n",
