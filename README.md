# The Spiking Neuron Model
**Code Repository for The Spiking Neuron Model chapter - Coding Challenge Problems**

There is a separate notebook for each model presented in the chapter. Click the links below leading to the corresponding Google Collab Notebook (with Python):

1. *The Integrate-and-Fire Spiking Neuron Model*: https://bit.ly/spiking-neuron-model-iafp1
2. *Extending the Model - Spike-Rate Adaptation*: https://bit.ly/spiking-neuron-model-iafsrap2
3. *The Hodgkin-Huxley Spiking Neuron Model*: https://bit.ly/spiking-neuron-model-hhp3
4. *Extending the Model - Synaptic-Conductance*: https://bit.ly/spiking-neuron-model-iafsynp4

## How It Works
Google Collab Notebooks have both *Content* cells and *Code* cells. As you progress through the notebook, you MUST make sure to run each code cell as you come to them.  Otherwise, you may run into errors when executing a code cell. Each code cell has a Play button next to it which will execute the code. (Some code may be hidden by default. This is generally because the code is more complex and is not necessary to understand in order to complete the model implementations or to answer the chapter Coding Challenge Problems).

**IMPORTANT**: You have been provided a link to view a **copy** of the original notebooks. You will find that you can edit the content of any cell. If you accidently change a cell, such as a line of code and/or run into errors as you try to run subsequent blocks, simply refresh the page, OR go to the *Runtime menu* and select *Restart runtime*. It is also suggested that you go to the *Edit menu* and select *Clear all outputs*. This will always allow you to revert the notebook to the original version (though you will have to run each code block again.)

For each model covered in the chapter, there is a section called **Coding Challenge Problems**. This is where you will find user-interface components such as value sliders for various parameters. Use these controls to answer the questions from the text.
