# Instructions
This Jupyter Notebook has both Content cells and Code cells. As you make your way through the tutorial, you MUST make sure to run each code cell as you come to them. Each code cell has a Play button next to it which will execute the code. Some code may be hidden (generally because it is more complex code not completely necessary to understand for the purposes of the chapter Coding Challenge Problems).

\*IMPORTANT: You have been provided a link to view a **copy** of the original notebook. You will find that you can edit the content of any cell. If you accidently change a cell, such as a line of code and/or run into errors as you try to run subsequent blocks, simply refresh the page, OR go to the *Runtime menu* and select *Restart runtime*. It is also suggested that you go to the *Edit menu* and select *Clear all outputs*. This will always allow you to revert the notebook to the original version (though you will have to run each code block again.)

For each model covered in the chapter, there is a section called **Simulations for Coding Challenge Problems**. This is where you will find user-interface components such as value sliders for various parameters. Use these controls to answer the questions from the text.
